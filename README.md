# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm Helena, a passionate and enthusiastic full-stack MERN web developer on an exciting journey of professional reinvention, with aspirations to evolve into a DevOps expert.

## 🚀 My Journey

My coding adventure kicked off with an immersive nine-week bootcamp at Ironhack in Madrid. Throughout this intense program, I delved deep into the world of web development, mastering a range of key technologies. From JavaScript, Node, Express, HTML, and CSS to Bootstrap, MongoDB, and ReactJS, I've been honing my skills and building a robust foundation for my developer career.

## 📸 From Photography to Coding

Before this exciting pivot, my background was as diverse as it gets. Armed with a degree in journalism, I spent eight fulfilling years as a photographer and videographer. My professional journey weaved through the corporate world and the social third sector, exposing me to various challenges and opportunities.

## 🎨 Unique Blend of Skills

This unique blend of experiences has enriched my skill set. Creativity, adaptability, strong problem-solving skills, and a keen eye for detail are qualities that I carry with me from my days behind the camera to my current role as a developer. I believe that this diverse background provides a fresh perspective and a unique approach to problem-solving in the world of technology.

## 🌐 Let's Connect

I'm passionate about coding, continuous learning, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing exciting projects, feel free to reach out!
